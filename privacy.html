            Our goal is to make an excellent app for you — not to track you. We
            don’t want to know anything about you unless you contact us
            yourself. We collect and retain the least information necessary to
            store your favorite recipes and help you with any occasional
            problem that might arise.
          </p>
          <p> 
            Key Points:
            <ul>
              <li>We don't track individual users in any way.</li>
              <li>We have not, and will not ever sell any data to advertisers or 3rd party companies.</li>
              <li>If you contact us for support, such as through email, we will delete your information after the resolution of your issue.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
